# liri-node-app

To creat this app we had to pull from 3 APIs
BandsInTown
Spotify
OMDB

Through Node we allow the user to have an input when searching for 3 various things. A band and they will get their next concert. A Song and they will get the band name and various other data points. Lastly, a movie and the user will receive various data points on the movie.
